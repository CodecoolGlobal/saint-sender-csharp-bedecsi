# SaintSender

Saint Sender is an e-mail (gmail only) viewing application (like Mozilla Thunderbird) using Windows Presentation Foundation.
Sadly, due to the way Google works, you can only log in with your account if you set your gmail account to be "less secure" in the Security settings.

Features:
- Check for internet connection
- E-mail viewing and sending
- Offline backup saving/loading
